## Brief
I wanted to become familiar with html, css and javascript by creating a create a functioning sudoku web app.

## Coding
At first I started with thinking about the main functions I would need for my sudoku game to function but quickly found that it was more effective to design the main layout of the web app using html and css first then fill in the funtionality with javascript instead of the other way round. This was critical as the way I decided to generate my sudoku board and numbers dictated the rest of my functions. Once that was done, I started thinking about what data I would need and how I would lke to send and receive it and added that in.

## UX/UI
I stuck to a simple colour scheme and tried to reduce the number of buttons e.g. not including a start and reset button under the stopwatch and automating it with the start game and giveup buttons.
I also ensured that the hover and highlight select colour of the numbers and tiles matched to make things intuitive and made the pre-filled numbers a different colour.
Everything is put at the centre of the page apart from the leaderboard and username textarea that are put to the side and hidden until needed if the user has sucessfully completed a game.

## Debugging
Debugging was especially critical. It was especially helpful in pointing out any functions that had yet to be defined or were referring to empty variables.

## Best Practice
Paying attention to jslint errors and naming files correctly. When creating functions, including a descriptive comment and naming them intuitively. In addition, functions were separated into different files where possible so it wasn't all cluttered into the main.js file.
